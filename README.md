## raceTrackingServer.exe
This folder contains three executables that will simulate a race.
You must first start up the `raceTrackingServer.exe` in order to properly start
a race simulation. From here you need to start up `client.exe` and `simulator.exe`
to start the race simulation.
## Building the project
I used intellij 2018 with gradle to build this project. this requires
jdk 18 or higher. Load the project into intellij by opening `Communicator`.
